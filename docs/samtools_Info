Convert BAM to SAM
# samtools view -h -o out.sam in.bam 
where h=includes header, o=output

Uniquely aligned reads from BAM, outputs uniquely mapped reads (and omit both unmapped and ambiguous ones). Ambiguous reads that can be mapped to different locations with the same score have mapping quality 0 in BWA.

# samtools view -bq 1 aln.bam > aln-reliable.bam
Unique reads have XT tag set to "U"
# samtools view bwa.bam | grep "XT:A:U"


Solexa : "Phred+33" scheme,
Illumina : "Phred+64" scheme


# BWA SAI index and samse info
1) Both optimal and suboptimal hits are stored in .sai files, but only
approximate chromosomal positions are available. Detailed alignments are
reconstructed by samse and sampe.
2) Sampe considers suboptimal hits in pairing.
However, there is no way to generate the detailed alignments for these suboptimal hits(in sam format) using samse, sampe.
